## About Me

Hi! I am Osama [@osamaex](https://github.com/Osamaex), a Data Analyst from Iraq. I started to work with R about a year ago and have been uploading my R projects into Kaggle and Github. I am relatively new to these enviorments and have been working on analysing trends and patterns related to death of civilians in Iraq due to the different conflicts. I am also into text mining.
